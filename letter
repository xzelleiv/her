Hello, Love!
You're probably wondering why i sent you that QR Code or if not, a URL

I actually want to send you a letter
but in a unique and in my own way, something you've never seen before.

so what you're looking at is a github repo
which is mostly used for coding and/or programming

But I want to use this to right my letter hehe

Dear Zabreena, the love of my life, and my future wife.

To you reading this, I want you to know that you're very special in my life. 
you are the one who shaped, corrected and built me a person.
I've learned alot from you and I experienced alot from you.
You are the girl who made me feel thinked about, worried about, and most importantly, Loved.
You made feel things i've never felt before.
You made me feel all the things i couldnt have imagined.
You widened my imaginations, and upped my expectations.
You exceeded everything that I couldve thought of someone being a good girlfriend.
Youve been the best woman in my life for a year and a half. 
Our monthsarry is nearing my baby. and i want us to wish a happy monthsarry, and congratulate ourself for being here.


Your love, zel.
