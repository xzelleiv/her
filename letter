shes living her best life while i was rotting, dying in bed. im crying harder and harder each day imagining what shes been doing. im glad that she's happyâ€”but it hurts that it's not because of me.



she did it because she liked someone else, she didnt have to make me look bad hahaha she couldve just told me that she likes someone else and id leave, i knew she deserves better but she doesnt have to do this to me, i gave her everything i have, i bought her everything she want, i did everything for her to be okay, i did everything to understand, i adjusted myself, i loved her more than myself, why does she have to do this to me
